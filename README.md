# DataStructuresAndAlgorithms
A comprehensive collection of C++ implementations for various data structures and algorithms. Each implementation is documented and includes unit tests. Ideal for students and developers looking to understand the core concepts of computer science.
This repo offers C++ implementations of fundamental data structures (like arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs) and algorithms (including sorting, searching, dynamic programming). Each implementation is thoroughly tested and documented.


## Overview
This repository will contain implementations of various data structures and algorithms in C++. Each implementation is documented with explanations and includes unit tests for validation.

## Contents
- **Data Structures:**
  - Arrays
  - Linked Lists
  - Stacks
  - Queues
  - Trees (Binary Trees, AVL Trees, etc.)
  - Graphs
  - Hash Tables
  - Heaps

- **Algorithms:**
  - Sorting (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
  - Searching (Binary Search, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, etc.)
  - Dynamic Programming (Knapsack Problem, Longest Common Subsequence, etc.)
  - Graph Algorithms (Dijkstra's, Prim's, Kruskal's, etc.)
  - String Algorithms (KMP, Rabin-Karp, etc.)

## Usage
Each data structure and algorithm is implemented in a self-contained C++ file. The corresponding unit tests are provided in the `tests` directory.

To compile and run the tests, use the following commands:
```bash
g++ -o test tests/test_dynamic_array.cpp
./test
